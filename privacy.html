    <h1>Privacy Policy – Global Talent Arena</h1>

    <p>Your privacy matters to us. This document explains what data we collect and why.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We only collect the information required for running talent competitions: videos you upload, 
        and basic competition participation data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. TikTok Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        If you choose to link your TikTok account, we only request the necessary scopes 
        (<strong>video.upload</strong> and <strong>video.publish</strong>) to upload videos on your behalf.
        No profile, follower, analytics or personal information is retrieved.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Storage of Data</h2>
    <p>
        Content and competition data are stored securely. Nothing is shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell or share personal data. TikTok only receives the video you explicitly decide to upload.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting our support team.
